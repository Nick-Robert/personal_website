            <p class = "qual-p"> I have the most experience programming in C++ and Python, both of which I've used extensively throughout my computer science classes. I've used C++ for about two years now, and I've used Python for over four years. I also have some experience programming in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, R, and Lua, along with using the libraries <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ReactJS</a> and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/Flask/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flask</a>, matplotlib, and numpy in Python. </p>
            <p class = "qual-p"> I also have some knowledge about basic machine learning concepts and an intermediate understanding of deep neural networks. I've read about the theory and math behind the deep neural networking algorithms, and I plan on trying my hand at a real project in the very near future to practice implementation. </p>
            <h3 class = "qual-headers">
                Technical Areas of interest
            </h3>
            <p class = "qual-p"> My primary interests in computer science include machine learning, or more specifically deep neural networking, and general backend development. I particularly enjoy machine learning since it's an extremely engaging and complex field with huge real-world applications. One of the things I most love to do is problem solve, and the field of machine learning offers an incredible challenge that I simply cannot resist. I also enjoy working with and processing data which is a huge part of machine learning applications. </p>
            <p class = "qual-p"> Since I love to problem solve, I also enjoy backend development. I haven't had much experience with developing code outside of school assignments, but the projects and assignments I've enjoyed the most involved a lot of data structures and algorithms. In the fall of 2021, one of my classes also required for numerous programs to use multithreading, which was also extremely interesting.</p>
