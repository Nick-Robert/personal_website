# Personal Website

This website will function as an extension to my resume where I can show off some front-end development skills and describe my qualifications, interests, passions, etc. in more depth.

I plan on using native HTML, CSS, and JS to continue work on this website, though I may add in elements from Python Flask and ReactJS if I find a decent use for them.
