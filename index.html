            <p> Howdy! My name is Nicholas Robert. I am a Senior Computer Engineering Honors student attending Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas. My interests in the computer engineering field are widespread, but I particularly enjoy back-end software development and machine learning. Recently, I've also started to learn about front-end development, including JavaScript, HTML, and CSS along with some frameworks/libraries like React and Python Flask. I plan to update this website along the way as I learn new things and sharpen my software development skills. Asides from my programming interests, I also have interests in economics, web3 and cryptocurrency, and rock, mineral, and gem collecting. I love to work out, read, and learn about as much as I can about those mentioned prior. I'm also developing an interest in philosophy and hope to learn more in the near future. </p>
            <p> I enjoy working in teams, but I also do not mind working alone; I work about as well alone as I do with a team. I have excellent written communication and presentation skills, and I am also competent in oral communication when given time to prepare. </p>
            <!-- <p> I'm looking for an internship position this summer related to computer science, preferably in back-end development. I'm open to virtual positions and to relocating for the summer; my email and LinkedIn can be found at the top of the page. </p> -->

            <h3> Service </h3>
            <p> The main service experience I participate in come from the Texas A&M's men's organization called Saw 'Em Off. I am an extremely active member in this group, and we participate in several service projects and events throughout the year. A couple of these include Highway Cleanup where we pick up litter on the side of a local Texas highway and the Big Event through Texas A&M University. We also coordinate with other campus organizations to host can drives, gather supplies for charity donations, and other similar activities.  </p>
